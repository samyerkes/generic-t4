##Getting help

###VCU Service Desk
All reports of incidents or service requests for the Generic Template should be reported through [VCU Service Desk](https://servicedesk.vcu.edu/). In Service Desk select *Application / System > Web CMS (Content Management System) > T4 / OpenText / WebCMS.* Please be sure to include the website and page you are working on in your ticket.

###Self-service support 
T4’s Extranet, located under the main menu’s Help tab, gives you access to online documentation and training materials.  The first time you access the Extranet, you will be prompted to accept T4’s terms and conditions.

##Getting started
*TERMINALFOUR (T4)* is a Content Management System (CMS) that allows you to modify website content.  As an end user, you have permission to add and modify text and images and establish links to websites, documents, PDFs and media files.

##Logging in
1.	Open your web browser and go to [t4.vcu.edu](http://t4.vcu.edu)
2.	Enter your **eID** and **password** using **CAS** (Central Authentication Services).
3.	The **T4 Site Manager** will launch.
4.	Click your username in the top right corner to open your user profile.
	1.	The default HTML editor is **TinyMCE**.
	2.	Websites are called “Channels.”  Under your User Details, if you work on several websites, you can set a default website (channel).  You can use your default channel to preview content on your live website. 

##The interface
The **Site Structure** screen is often the starting point when working with content.  To return to the **Site Structure screen**, do one of the following:

*	Go to **Content** and select **Site Structure**.
*	Click on **Site Structure** in the **header menu**.
*	Click on the **T4 logo** in the top left corner.

To navigate between screens without losing data, **use T4 Site Manager's navigation (rather than your browser’s buttons)**. If you navigate away from a screen without saving your data first, you run the risk of losing your data.

If you’re not already on the **Site Structure** screen, click the **Site Structure** icon located in the top menu bar.

T4 names the base of your website, **“Site Structure”** and it includes **sections (folders)** displayed with different symbols. **Sections** represent specific web pages. Within folders, you may encounter the following symbols: 

##Direct Edit

###How to access Direct Edit
The quickest way to begin adding and editing content to a webpage is to access **Direct Edit** by the following methods:

####Method 1
1.    From the **Site Structure**, select **Direct Edit** from the **Section Drop-Down Menu**:
2.    A **Direct Edit** screen opens with a red dotted line surrounding content you have permission to edit. The **Direct Edit menu** is displayed at the top of the screen; use the orange toggle button to show/hide the **Direct Edit** menu.

####Method 2
You can access **Direct Edit** by clicking the **Pencil Icon** located in the footer of your website:

###Direct Edit: how to add content to current page with Direct Edit
In **Direct Edit**, a **Page** is considered the editable area on the page. A **Page** can consist of multiple pieces of content. Different types of content can be added to a page as required.

1.    To add new content to the current page, click Add Content to Current Page.
2.    Select from the available list of Content Types for adding content. Your options will be:
	1.    **General Page Article** - This is used for most content.
	2.    **Photo Gallery Image** - Used to add a new photo and description to one of the photo gallery pages.

###Direct Edit: how to add a new page
In **Direct Edit**, a **Section** is referred to as a **Page**, as it can only function as such. There is no option for creating Link Sections, Hidden Sections, etc. 

New pages are added under the page you are currently in.

1.    Select the page under which you wish to add the new page.‌
2.    Click **Add New Page**.
3.    Enter the page name and click **Add**. If **Access Control** is enabled, you can check the **Restrict Access** box to determine which visitors to the published site will be able to view the page. Visitors hence need to log in or be identified as having permission. This is based on **T4 Site Manager groups**.

###Direct Edit: how to modify a web page

1.    Select the **Page** you wish to **Modify**.
2.    Click **Modify** in the **Direct Edit** toolbar.
3.    You can modify the name of the **Page**. (Please note this will also modify the url.)
4.    **Restrict Access** this feature is not available. 
5.    Click **Update** to save any changes.

###Direct Edit: how to delete content
You can delete content using **Direct Edit**. Deleted content will be removed from view however the content will remain in the **T4 Site Manager** as **Inactive** until purged by the Administrator.  Once this happens, the content and its history will be deleted from the database and cannot be restored.

In order to delete content from the live site, a **Publish** must run to reflect changes made in **T4 Site Manager**.

1.    Hover your mouse over the editable region of the content to bring up a small menu – highlighted below:
2.    The **Delete** content pop-up screen appears; select **Delete**.

###Direct Edit: how to delete a page
In Direct Edit, you can Delete an entire Page. Deleted Pages will be marked inactive and no longer visible on the live site once an updated publish runs. Again, deleted content will remain in the T4 Site Manager installation until purged by the Administrator.

1.    Select the **Page** you wish to **Delete**.
2.    Click Delete in the **Direct Edit** toolbar.
	1.    A warning box appears; if you are sure you want to delete the page, **click OK**.

When you delete a page, it remains in the system until an Administrator approves the deletion.  Once approved for deletion, the page and any content it contained (plus its history) will be purged from the database. **This cannot be restored**.  

In order to delete the page from the live site, a **Publish** must be run to reflect changes made in T4 Site Manager.

###Direct Edit: how to approve content
**Approve** refers to the process of reviewing and managing new or modified content. Content needs to go through an approval process in order to publish to your site.

####Content Status Icons
Each piece of content has a status indicator so you can tell whether it is approved or pending. Only approved content will be published.

####Approve content from the Direct Edit toolbar
1.    If you want to view a list of content waiting to be approved by you, select **Approve** from the **Direct Edit toolbar**. This will display content currently pending approval. If you are logged in as an Administrator, this list will include all pending content items.
2.    To examine, review, approve or reject a piece of content, click the title of the content. This will take you to the T4 Site Manager approve menu.
3.    It is also possible to check one or several content items for approval and click **Approve Content**.

###Direct Edit: how to view content history
1.    Hover your mouse over the editable region of the content. This will bring up a small menu – highlighted below.
2.    Click **.History**. and the following **.View Content History**. pop-up appears.

####How to use an older version of content
All previous versions of content will be displayed (see above).  To revert to an earlier version of content, click **Set Active** beside the version of content you wish to use. The version currently in use will be the one for which no Set Active option exists.  A version might be listed more than once because it will display each time it was previously used.

###Direct Edit: how to access the Site Structure
The Site Structure is a hierarchy of a website. Depending on configuration, you may only see pages you have been given access to.  The Site Structure can be accessed from the Direct Edit toolbar, which allows for quick and easy navigation to other pages (sections) of your site. Pages (sections) in the Site Structure can be moved by "drag and drop" (if you are a Moderator).

1.    To access the **Site Structure**, select it from the **Direct Edit toolbar**.

##The WYSIWYG Editor
WYSIWYG stands for “What you see is what you get.” This is a great tool for users who don’t know how to write code to jump right in and start making and updating content on the web just like they would with a Microsoft Word document. The WYSIWYG editor consists of a large content area and a toolbar at the top for styling your web content. We will now highlight the most popular tools in the WYSIWYG editor.

###Headings
Headings are different from just bold. They inherit the css styles from the stylesheet and provide context in terms of accessibility and search engine optimization. When editing content you should start with the Heading 1 and work your way down to the least important heading (Heading 6). This is comparable to making an outline for a paper. *Note: Headings are not to be used as a replacement to using bold.*

###Bold
To bold text, highlight the text and select the “B” character in the top left of the WYSIWYG. This is to be used sparingly and not as a replacement of a heading.

###Italic
To italicize text, highlight the text and select the “I” character in the top left of the WYSIWYG. This is to be used sparingly and appropriately.

###Underline
To underline text, highlight the text and select the “U” character in the top left of the WYSIWYG.

###Lists
Lists are a common way to write out instructions or important content points that need to be scanned quickly. There are two types of lists, **ordered** and **unordered**. Ordered lists are numbered in sequential order 1., 2., 3., etc. and are good for instructions. Unordered lists are preceded with bullet points. 

To make an ordered list select the **ordered list** button in the WYSIWYG editor, type out the first point. After the first point is complete hit the return key to start the next point. To exit from writing list items hit return twice.

To make an **unordered list** select the ordered list button in the WYSIWYG editor, type out the first point. After the first point is complete hit the return key to start the next point. To exit from writing list items hit return twice.

###Links
There are three different types of links: internal, external and jump links.

####Internal links
Internal links will jump a user to a new page that is currently in T4. To make an internal link highlight the text you want to link to the new page and click on the internal link button.

Once you click on the button you will be presented with a popup modal to select the internal page you want to link to.

####External links
External links will direct a user to a page external from the T4 system. To make an external link highlight the text you want to link to the external page and click on the external link button.

Once you click on this button you will be presented with a popup modal to input the link you want your visitor to be directed to, if you want the new page to open up in the same tab or window, and the title of the link (to add information about the nature of the link). Once you are done filling out the information hit **Insert** to place the link in your content.

####Jump links
Jump links are links that will change the users position on the current page to a specific applicable section. These links require the link and also the destination, known as the anchor, to be input through the WYSIWYG editor.

The first step is setting the anchor. To do so, highlight the text or image element that you want your user to be jumped to and hit the **Insert/edit** anchor button. A popup modal will be displayed to name the anchor. You should name this something specific to the content but it doesn’t necessarily matter what it is. After you hit okay you’ll notice a small anchor icon next to the content you had selected.

The next step is to select the element that points the user to the anchored content. To do so, highlight the text or image element and select the regular link button (the same one we used for the external link). You’ll notice this time we have a selection for **Anchors**. Choose the anchor you previously made and click **Insert**.

##Media Library
The **Media Library** stores images, docs , PDFs, media files, etc.  ‌

###How to add a media item
A media item is an image, audio file, Microsoft Office document, PDF, etc.  Click on the relevant category to see media items currently stored in that category or right-click on the category and select **Show Existing** from the pop-up menu.

1.    To add a new media item to a category, select a category.
2.    Click the ‌**Add Media button** in the toolbar OR right-click on category and select **Add New** from the pop-up menu.
3.    The **Media Type** opens, allowing you to add a media item.

###How to delete a media item
When a media item is deleted, it will be deleted from all of the categories it belongs to. **If a media item is used in content, it will disappear from the content.

1.    To delete a media item, locate it in the Media Library and select Advanced.
2.    Select the Original Version to delete the entire media item or select the relevant Variant and click Delete.
3.    Click OK to confirm.

###How to use media in content
Media can be inserted into content directly from the **Media Library** or directly into content from elements within the **Content Type**. 

The example below shows how to insert an image, but any type of file or media can be inserted into a webpage.

1.    To insert an image from the Media Library, click **Insert Media** in the **TinyMCE Editor**. The Media Library is displayed.
2.    Locate the media item you wish to insert and click **Select**. If the file is not in the Media Library, click **Add Media** to upload the new file.
3.    After the item is inserted, right-click or double-click on the image to **Edit Media Attributes**.

###How to insert other media from the Media Library
Other media files are inserted following the process above. For documents and PDFs you can edit the display of the name in **Media Attributes**.

##How to review and approve content
New or modified content needs to go through an approval process before it can be published. If you have permission to approve content, it will appear in the list of content awaiting approval in the **Approve section**.

Keep in mind:

*	Content approval can be done from **Direct Edit**.
*	If selective approval is enabled, you can approve content by checking the **Approve box** beside the content and then click **Approve**.
*	The **Approve Content** screen will refresh itself periodically.
*	Content with a **Rejected** status will never be published. Rejected content, once updated, must be approved before it will be published.
*	Content with a **Draft** status will not appear in the Approval menu and will not be published. **Draft** content, once updated, must be approved before it will be published.

When new content is created or existing content modified in **T4 Site Manager**, its status is set to **Pending**.  To access the list of content pending your approval, go to **Content** and select **Approve Content**.

The **Approve Content** screen contains up to three tabs: **Pending, Inactive** and **Workflow**. The Inactive and Workflow tabs might be hidden by default.  The **Selective Approval** box (the check box for bulk-approving content) can be enabled for Moderators.

To find the content, sort by **Name, Priority** and **Last Modified**. Simply click on the heading to sort the content.  To review a piece of pending content, simply click on the **Name** of the content to open the **Content Details**.

This screen allows you access to the following:

*	**Edit** - allows you to modify the piece of content in the **Content Type** used.
*	**Show History** - displays the audit trail for all versions of this piece of content.
*	**Published Channels** - allows you to preview the content in any channel related to the content.
*	**Compare with last approved version** - allows you to compare the current version with the last approved version (if the content was previously approved).
*	**Comment** - only available if the content is in a workflow and allows the reviewer to add comments for other reviewers to see.
*	**Fast Track** - is available if content is in a **workflow** and the reviewer is the Administrator. It allows the reviewer to fast track the content through a workflow. If, for instance, four people are involved in a step in the workflow and the reviewer needs to bypass the other three reviewers, **Advance to Next Step** allows this. If the purpose is to get the content to its final approved stage in one go, **Advance to Completion** allows this.
*	**Approve** - means it will publish when the channel is published.
*	**Reject** - allows you to reject the content; if rejected, the content will remain pending.

After reviewing the content, click **Approve or Reject**.

Once you click **Approve** on a piece of content, the content moves to the next stage. If no workflow is enabled, the content's status changes to approved and it will be included in the next publish.  The content is immediately removed from the list of pending content in the **Approval** list. 

If you check the **Site Structure**, the content will appear in the **green column**.

**You cannot “un-approve” a piece of content so do not approve content until it is complete.**

##How to publish content
Once content has been approved, it still needs to be published before it will appear on your website. In the following sections you will learn about the difference between **Publish Section** and **Publish Branch**. To access both options navigate back to the **Site Manager**, hovering over the yellow arrow will reveal the action menu. The last two options of the action menu include the two publishing options.

###Publish Section
The first publishing option is **Publish Section**. This option will only publish out the new or edited content on that page specific page.

After selecting **Publish Section** a pop-up will open. Check the **Publish Output** checkbox and click **Submit**.

###Publish Branch
The section publishing option is **Publish Branch**. This option will publish out the new or edited content on that specific section and all its child sections.

After selecting **Publish Branch** a pop-up will open. Check the **Publish Output** checkbox and click **Submit**.

*Note: If you have modified a piece of content that may appear higher up in the website then it is important to use **Publish Branch** from the highest section that that change may affect. For instance if you change the name of a second level page and use **Publish Branch** on this section, only this second level section and its children (the 3rd, 4th, and so on sections) will have the new page name. In this scenario the 1st level page (the homepage) would still have the old page name until it was republished. In this instance you would want to use **Publish Section** on the Homepage so the change takes effect throughout the entire site.*

##How to undo deleted Content and Pages
If you have deleted a page it will show up as highlighted red in your site structure. To undo this click on the sites name in the site structure. You will be taken to the **General** tab. In the **Status** drop down the page will be set to **Inactive**, click the drop down and select **Approved**. Click **Update**. 

To undo deleted content: 

Click Modify content from your site structure to get to your Content tab, find the content with an Inactive status set. 

In the yellow action menu next to the piece of content, click Modify. 

You will be taken into edit mode, choose **Update and Approve** at the top to bring the content out of delete status. 

##How to override your themes global styles
The Generic T4 template comes with a way to override some of its base CSS styles. This functionality gives the user a way to still be under the template but have a unique look. To modify the global styles, locate the **Assets-Style** section and modify the **GBoot Global Styles** content type. Most of these fields accept web safe colors, hex values or pixel values (px).

##Global header and footer
Content added to the Header or Footer will show up globally on every page throughout your site. 

###How to change the header and footer
Locate the **Assets-Header** or **Assets-Footer** section under Home highlighted below and click on the name.

Navigate to the **Content tab** and you will see a list of all the content types. Click on each piece of content by first clicking on the yellow dropdown arrow and then **Modify**. New content can be added by clicking on the “Add Content” button. Content order can be rearranged by moving it up and down with the move arrows and then clicking “Save Changes.”

###Header and footer requirements
The VCU Branding Bar is a requirement for all VCU sites and should be the first piece of content in your header.

Typically your site will need a Navigation Menu and Site Title content type. These can be in whatever order you wish. More information on both of those content types is available in the Content Types section.

The last two pieces of content in your footer should be the Social Media and Footer Info content (in that order). Even if you do not have any social media accounts you want to add to your website this is need or your template will not work correctly. If you do not have any social media accounts you can simply remove and leave blank all the social media fields so that none show.

##Changing the homepage
To change the content on the homepage you can click on the Home from the Site Manager. Content can be added, removed, and reordered just like any other page. The homepage uses the “GBoot Home” template (this should already be set for you). 

Some content added to this page will render slightly different than if they were added to an inner page. For instance adding a Photo Slideshow content type on the homepage will span the entire width of the page as opposed to being inside any container. Another good example of an alternative style on the homepage vs. the inner page is the jumbotron content type. On a inner page the jumbotron content display inside the page container, but on the homepage is spans the entire width of the browser providing a different visual element.

Lastly the “Slice” content type can only be used on the homepage. More information on Slice is available in the Content Types section.

##Adding a news page
A news page is a special page because it includes three different views for displaying it’s content. The content has an excerpt view (typically shown on the actual news page), a detailed view (which displays the entire story and is linked from the excerpt), and then lastly the headlines can be pulled into another content type and added to any page by using the New Headlines Content Type. 

A news page is easily made by adding the News Item content type to a dedicated page. An excerpt on the actual news page and the full news story page will be automatically made.

*It is recommended to keep a consistent size for the news item thumbnail images. The size in the following example is 90x90px.*

##Adding a staff listing page
A staff listing can be made by adding a combination of the Staff Directory and Staff Listing content types onto a page. 

After clicking on someone in the staff listing you are presented with their own “profile page,” which can include a bio and picture.

The Staff Directory content type should be first and then followed by a Staff Listing content type for each person on staff. It is also recommended to include an automatic ordering method on this page to alphabetically order staff. To enable automatic ordering click on the Content tab and there is a selection for ordering method. *Note: the content name is what is ordered so if you want staff members ordered by last name then you must write that into their content’s name field, as shown below.*

##Content types

###2 Columns
The 2 Columns content type creates two columns of content using the HTML WYSIWYG editor for both columns. It also gives you the ability to add optional headings for those columns.

###2 Column Pull
The 2 Columns Pull content type pulls in the content from hidden child sections called "Column_1", and "Column_2". This way you can reuse any special components and add them into a specific column. It also gives you the ability to add optional headings for those columns.

###2 Columns Offset (84/48)
The Columns 2-84 and Columns 2-48 content types create two columns of content using the HTML WYSIWYG editor for both columns. One column is twice as big as the other creating an offset effect. 84 corresponds to the left side being 8 grids wide and right side being 4 grids wide; while the opposite is true for 48. It also gives you the ability to add optional headings for those columns.

###2 Columns Offset (84/48) Pull
The Columns 2-84 and Columns 2-48 content types create two columns of content by pulling in the content from hidden child sections called "Column_1", and "Column_2". This way you can reuse any special components and add them into a specific column. One column is twice as big as the other creating an offset effect. 84 corresponds to the left side being 8 grids wide and right side being 4 grids wide; while the opposite is true for 48. It also gives you the ability to add optional headings for those columns.

###3 Columns
The 3 Columns content type creates two columns of content using the HTML WYSIWYG editor for all three columns. It also gives you the ability to add optional headings for those columns.

###3 Column Pull
The 3 Columns Pull content type pulls in the content from hidden child sections called "Column_1", "Column_2", and "Column_3". This way you can reuse any special components and add them into a specific column. It also gives you the ability to add optional headings for those columns.

###Accordion
This content type breaks up content into collapsable sections. A user can designate up to five sections. The accordion will span the entire width of the content area.

###CAS Authentication
The CAS Authentication content type lets users designate a list of eIDs that are able to access the page and subpages via CAS authentication. To use this content type drop the CAS Authentication content type on the first page you want to authenticate and then fill in the user’s eid in the user field. Multiple users should be separated by single space. 

*Note: this content type will not show up in the T4 preview screen, but will work once you publish out to the live site.*

###Child Pages List
This content type automatically pulls in the [Page Meta](#page-meta) from its child pages and displays it in an orderly list. Only child pages with meta information will be included in the list.

###Content Well
The Content Well content type moves HTML content into a colored div. The div has the option to be different colors and should be used to make average content stand out or show importance.

The four colors are:

*	Default (Gray)
*	Danger (Red)
*	Info (Blue)
*	Success (Green)
*	Warning (Yellow)

###Footer
The Footer content type allows users to add generic contact info into a floated section in the footer. This content type fulfills the VCU standards and guidelines for contact info on VCU webpages. It is also required to be the last piece of content in the [global footer](#header-and-footer-requirements). *This content type can only be added to the footer.*

###General Content
The General Content content type allows users to add any content such as written copy, tables, links, headings, photos or external documents. Users should find this content type familiar as it provides common functionalities such as the ability to bold, italicize and underline content. For General Content type uses one [WYSIWYG editor](#the-wysiwyg-editor).

###Jumbotron
The Jumbotron content type displays a stylized div that can have content inside. The user can optionally set a photo background and custom text color to style how they would like. If a photo background is not chosen the content type defaults to a gold background. If a photo background is chosen it is suggested to apply a colored overlay in a photo editing program so the text is still readable. The example below uses a photo that has a #000000 (black) overlay with 50% opacity.

The text color can be set by either including a valid hex code (#000000) or by writing a [web safe color name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#HTML_color_names).

If the Jumbotron is added to the homepage then it will span across the entire width of the browser

###Navigation Menu
The navigation menu content type allows you to display your second level pages in a navigational bar. **This content type is used only in the Asset-Header page** but can be moved up or down depending on if you want your navigation menu before or after other global header content. It also includes the option to have your links left, center, or right aligned. 

###News Headlines
This content type automatically pulls in the headlines of the last three news items into an unordered list. Users can also include an optional heading.

###News Items
The News Items content type is used to add news items to a dedicated news section of your website. Users are able to specify a title, date, excerpt, excerpt thumbnail, and the full story content for their news items. These news items can then be used throughout the site, see the next section on [News Headlines](#news-headlines). 

*Note: This content type is only to be added to a dedicated [news section page](#adding-a-news-page)*

###Page Meta
The Page Meta content type is not a visual content type. It is used to dedicate page level info so that that info can be used in other places of your site without duplicating that content in multiple places. The main content type that uses Page Meta is the [Child Pages List](#child-pages-list) content type, but it is likely this will be expanded in later versions of the template. Ideally every page on your site should have a Page Meta content type added.

Options include adding a page image and page description. It is suggested to establish a meta image default size; 90x90px is a good base point.

###Photo Slideshow
This content type gives the user the option to add up to ten photos into an interactive slideshow. The user has the option to toggle the carousel controls and indicator on/off, add captions for all the photos individually, and choose whether the photos fade or slide in and out.

If this content type is applied to the homepage then it will span the entire width of the browser.

###Responsive Embed
The Responsive Embed content type gives the user a place to embed an iframe video or media element (youtube, vimeo, etc.) into a dedicated responsive wrapper. This will ensure your videos have the right aspect ratios on tablet and mobile devices.

###Slice
A slice content type pulls in content from a hidden child section called "Slice". This is used to provide a full page colored div that separates content on the page. **This content type can only be used on the homepage.**

Here is an example how to implement a slice content type on your homepage. First add the slice content type to your homepage. After create a hidden child section of your homepage called “Slice” and insert whatever content you want to include in your slice inside of that.

###Social Media
The social media content type allows for users to add linked icons in their footer to their various social media presences. This content type offers icons for all the main social media websites. To add a new social media link, modify the content and paste the url into the plain text field that corresponds with the social network you are adding.

*Note: this content type is only available to be added into the footer.*

###Tabs
The Tabs content type gives the user the option to add WYSIWYG content into tabbed form. This content types allows up to five tabs.

It is recommended to keep the tab titles short so they all fit on one line.

###VCU Dates
The VCU Dates content type lets the user add a feed from the official VCU Calendar. The feed should be configured at: [http://www.pubinfo.vcu.edu/calendar/calXMLurl4.asp](http://www.pubinfo.vcu.edu/calendar/calXMLurl4.asp). Users have the ability to optional show the day of the week, show the year, and designate the number of entries they would like to include.

##Getting started
*TERMINALFOUR (T4)* is a Content Management System (CMS) that allows you to modify website content.  As an end user, you have permission to add and modify text and images and establish links to websites, documents, PDFs and media files.

##Getting help

###VCU Service Desk
All reports of incidents or service requests for the Generic Template should be reported through [VCU Service Desk](https://servicedesk.vcu.edu/). In Service Desk select *Application / System > Web CMS (Content Management System) > T4 / OpenText / WebCMS.* Please be sure to include the website and page you are working on in your ticket.

###Self-service support 
T4’s Extranet, located under the main menu’s Help tab, gives you access to online documentation and training materials.  The first time you access the Extranet, you will be prompted to accept T4’s terms and conditions.

##Logging in
1.	Open your web browser and go to [t4.vcu.edu](http://t4.vcu.edu)
2.	Enter your **eID** and **password** using **CAS** (Central Authentication Services).
3.	The **T4 Site Manager** will launch.
4.	Click your username in the top right corner to open your user profile.
	1.	The default HTML editor is **TinyMCE**.
	2.	Websites are called “Channels.”  Under your User Details, if you work on several websites, you can set a default website (channel).  You can use your default channel to preview content on your live website. 

##The interface
The **Site Structure** screen is often the starting point when working with content.  To return to the **Site Structure screen**, do the following:
*	Go to **Content** and select **Site Structure**.
*	Click on **Site Structure** in the **header menu**.
*	Click on the **T4 logo** in the top left corner.

To navigate between screens without losing data, **use T4 Site Manager's navigation (rather than your browser’s buttons)**. If you navigate away from a screen without saving your data first, you run the risk of losing your data.

If you’re not already on the **Site Structure** screen, click the **Site Structure** icon located in the top menu bar.

T4 names the base of your website, **“Site Structure”** and it includes **sections (folders)** displayed with different symbols. **Sections** represent specific web pages. Within folders, you may encounter the following symbols: 

##Direct Edit

###How to access Direct Edit
The quickest way to begin adding and editing content to a webpage is to access **Direct Edit** by the following methods:

####Method 1
1.    From the **Site Structure**, select **Direct Edit** from the **Section Drop-Down Menu**:
2.    A **Direct Edit** screen opens with a red dotted line surrounding content you have permission to edit. The **Direct Edit menu** is displayed at the top of the screen; use the orange toggle button to show/hide the **Direct Edit** menu.

####Method 2
You can access **Direct Edit** by clicking the **Pencil Icon** located in the footer of your website:

###How to add content to current page with Direct Edit
In Direct Edit, a Page is considered the editable area on the page. A Page can consist of multiple pieces of content. Different types of content can be added to a page as required.
